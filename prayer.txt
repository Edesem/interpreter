In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy  
Spirit. Amen. 

Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal, have mercy on us. (Thrice) 

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, 
both now and ever and to the ages of ages. Amen. 

All-holy Trinity, have mercy on us. Lord, cleanse us from 
our sins. Master, pardon our iniquities. Holy One visit and 
heal our infirmities for Your Nameâ€™s sake. 

Lord, have mercy. (Thrice) 

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, 
both now and ever and to the ages of ages. Amen. 

Our Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy Name. 
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in 
heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our 
trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And 
lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.
